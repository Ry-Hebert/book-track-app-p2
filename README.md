# DGM-3760-Book Track App
 
### This project is hosted on netlify

As a user, I want to be able to search for books
As a user I want to be able to add books from my search results to my list of books to read, or books I have read
As a user, I want to track books I have read
As a user, I need to be able to rate books I have read
As a user, I want to be able to make a list of books I want to read
The App must be well designed and have a well thought out user interface with a focus on the user experience. (While this ins't a design class, often times a developer will have to make these choices)
